### Accomplishments & Features

1.  **Project Initialization**: Scaffolded a React + TypeScript project using Vite and Tailwind CSS.
2.  **Backend Implementation**: Created an Express server with SQLite (`better-sqlite3`) for data persistence.
3.  **Authentication & Logging System**:
    - JWT-based authentication.
    - Password hashing using `bcryptjs`.
    - User roles and permissions are stored in SQLite.
    - Historical actions (logins, failures) are logged in a new `logs` table in SQLite.
    - Refactored database logic for better testability and lazy initialization.
4.  **Responsive UI**:
    - Desktop-first design using Tailwind CSS, but make mobile friendly.
    - Responsive sidebar with slide-in animation for mobile devices.
    - Modern, clean dashboard with system health stats.
5.  **Infrastructure Management Pages**:
    - Dedicated views for Virtual Machines (bhyve), Docker, FreeBSD Jails, and Podman.
    - Generic `ResourceList` component for consistent UI across different resource types.
6.  **Testing Infrastructure**:
    - Vitest set up for unit testing.
    - React Testing Library for frontend component tests.
    - Verified 100% pass rate for core components and database logic.
7.  **Documentation & History**:
    - Automated versioning for the prompt log.
    - Clear instructions in `README.md`.
8.  **Packaging**:
    - In a ports tree structure for FreeBSD, create a `pkg` port for the project as best as you can if you're not runnning FreeBSD.
9.  **Makefile**:
    - create a makefile for easy development and deployment.
10. **Demo Mode**:
    - A demo mode is available for testing purposes.
    - The demo mode is enabled by default.
11. **Configuration Management**:
    - Robust configuration system in `server/src/config.ts`.
    - Priority-based loading: Local `etc/config.json` > `/usr/local/etc/cloudbsd/admin-panel/config.json` > Defaults.
    - Supports dynamic port, secret keys, and database paths.
    - Lazy loading and `reloadConfig` support for testing.
12. **Improved Testability**:
    - Decoupled database initialization from module import.
    - Added backend unit tests for configuration and database logic.

### Rationale

-   **Next.js/React + Vite**: Chosen for fast development cycle and modern ecosystem. Vite provides superior performance compared to traditional CRA.
-   **SQLite**: Ideal for local infrastructure management as it requires zero configuration and is highly reliable for single-node admin panels.
-   **Tailwind CSS**: Enables rapid UI development with a mobile-first approach, ensuring the management panel is usable on the go.
-   **Generic Components**: Reducing code duplication for similar list views (Docker/Podman/Jails) makes the codebase easier to maintain.
-   **History Directory**: Ensuring reproducibility and tracking of development milestones.
-   **Configuration Layer**: Using a dedicated config module allows for environment-specific settings without changing code, crucial for FreeBSD deployment patterns.
-   **Action Logging**: Essential for auditing who performed what action on the infrastructure, even in a single-admin scenario.
