### Accomplishments & Features

1.  **Project Initialization**: Scaffolded a React + TypeScript project using Vite and Tailwind CSS.
2.  **Backend Implementation**: Created an Express server with SQLite (`better-sqlite3`) for data persistence.
3.  **Authentication System**:
    - JWT-based authentication.
    - Password hashing using `bcryptjs`.
    - User roles and permissions stored in SQLite.
4.  **Responsive UI**:
    - Mobile-first design using Tailwind CSS.
    - Responsive sidebar with slide-in animation for mobile devices.
    - Modern, clean dashboard with system health stats.
5.  **Infrastructure Management Pages**:
    - Dedicated views for Virtual Machines (bhyve), Docker, FreeBSD Jails, and Podman.
    - Generic `ResourceList` component for consistent UI across different resource types.
6.  **Testing Infrastructure**:
    - Vitest set up for unit testing.
    - React Testing Library for frontend component tests.
    - Verified 100% pass rate for core components and database logic.
7.  **Documentation & History**:
    - Automated versioning for the prompt log.
    - Clear instructions in `README.md`.

### Rationale

-   **Next.js/React + Vite**: Chosen for fast development cycle and modern ecosystem. Vite provides superior performance compared to traditional CRA.
-   **SQLite**: Ideal for local infrastructure management as it requires zero configuration and is highly reliable for single-node admin panels.
-   **Tailwind CSS**: Enables rapid UI development with a mobile-first approach, ensuring the management panel is usable on the go.
-   **Generic Components**: Reducing code duplication for similar list views (Docker/Podman/Jails) makes the codebase easier to maintain.
-   **History Directory**: Ensuring reproducibility and tracking of development milestones.
